# Machine learning development cycle (MLDLC/MLDC)


### 1. Frame the problem


### 2. Gathering data 
- CSV
- API
- Web Scrapping

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Remove Duplicates
- Remove missing values
- Identify Outliers
- Scale the data

### 4. Exploratory Data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the data
- Handeling imbalance datasets
- Understanding the dataset through univariate and bivariate plots

### 5. Feature Engineering and selection
- You draw new features from data which is impactful for the output
- Select your import features
- Remove unwanted columns or features

### 6. Model training Evaluation and selection
- Try different types of algorithm
- Evaluate the performance for each and select the algorithm accordingly
- Parameter tuning
- Ensemble learning

### 7. Model Deplyoment
- Create a binary file for the model and create an API for the model
- Deploy on some web or app 

### 8. Testing
- Test your model
- User feedback

### 9. Optimize
- Load Balancing
- Model Retraining
- Backup
